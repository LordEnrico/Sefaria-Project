                <span>We the People. With three simple words, the American founders changed the course of world history by entrusting the future of our country directly to the people. But with great power comes great responsibility. The success of the American experiment depends on an informed, engaged, and united American people.</span>

                    Our vision is for an informed and engaged citizenry. In the words of James Madison, Father of the American Constitution, “Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who means to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives”.

                ContextUS provides a platform for users to read texts, search concepts, and engage others in conversation. As our name suggests, our goal is to provide historical and philosophical context to modern political debates. In the age of internet misinformation, ContextUS brings Americans straight to the source.
